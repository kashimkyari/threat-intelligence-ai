# Threat Intelligence AI Platform

## Overview
This repository contains the code for an AI-powered threat intelligence platform designed to gather, analyze, and visualize cybersecurity threat data from various sources. Leveraging machine learning algorithms, the platform detects emerging threats, predicts attack patterns, and recommends proactive security measures tailored to organizations based on their industry, geography, and risk profile. The platform is capable of processing data from dark web forums, social media platforms, and malware repositories, providing valuable insights to enhance cybersecurity defenses.

## Features
- Scrapes data from multiple sources such as dark web forums, social media platforms, and malware repositories.
- Preprocesses and cleans the gathered data for analysis.
- Uses machine learning algorithms to detect emerging threats and predict attack patterns.
- Provides recommendations for proactive security measures based on threat analysis.
- Visualizes threat intelligence data through interactive dashboards and visualizations.
